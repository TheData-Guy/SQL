## SQL 

SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

## What Can SQL do ?

- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve data from a database
- SQL can insert records in a database
- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views.

## What is Database ?

- Database is the collection of organized data which is structured and is stored electronically on a computer system. Databases can store data in the form of tables depending upon the type of database. The database's primary goal is to store a huge amount of data.

- Databases are used to store a large number of dynamic websites on the Internet today. Data can then be accessed, managed, updated, regulated, and organized efficiently. For writing and retrieving data, most databases utilize structured query language (SQL).

## What is DBMS ( Database Management System ) ?

 - Database Management System (DBMS) is a software used for the storage, access and manipulation of data. Along with this, DBMS helps in securing data and getting useful insights from it. Common DBMS software are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.

## What is RDBMS ( Relational Database Management System ) ?

  - An RDBMS is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a row-based table structure which connects related data elements. An RDBMS includes functions that maintain the security, accuracy, integrity and consistency of the data. 

## NoSQL Database 

 - NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

### NoSQL Database Feature 
 
- Flexible schemas
- Horizontal scaling
- Fast queries due to the data model
- Ease of use for developers

### Type of NoSQL Database

- *Document databases* store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.
- Key-value databases are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.
- Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns.
- Graph databases store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things, while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.
